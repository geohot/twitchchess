== Other Crap ==

* Establish the search tree
* Use a neural net to prune the search tree

Definition: Value network
V = f(state)

What is V?
V = -1 black wins board state
V = 0 draw board state
V = 1 white wins board state

Should we fix the value of the initial board state?

What's the value of "about to lose"?

Simpler:
All positions where white wins = 1
All positions where draw = 0
All positions where black wins = -1

State(Board):

Pieces(2+7*2 = 16):
* Universal
** Blank
** Blank (En passant)
* Pieces
** Pawn
** Bishop
** Knight
** Rook
** Rook (can castle)
** Queen
** King

Extra state:
* To move

8x8x5 = 257 bits (vector of 0 or 1)
